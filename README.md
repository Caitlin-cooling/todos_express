# This is a practise exercise in using express

## To use to this application
1. Git clone `https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/todos_express.git`
2.  `npm install` to install dependancies
3. `mongod` to run the mongo daemon (please ensure that you have mongodb installed locally)
4. In another terminal window run `mongo` to start the mongo server

## Dependancies
* MongoDB is used as the database
* Mongoose is used as the ODM
* Express is used as Node.js framework
