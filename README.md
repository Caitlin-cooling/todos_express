# Todos Api
This is a practise exercise in using express to create a RESTful API.

## To use to this application
1. Git clone `https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/todos_express.git`
2.  `npm install` to install dependancies
3. `mongod` to run the mongo daemon (please ensure that you have mongodb installed locally)
4. In another terminal window run `mongo` to start the mongo server
5. To run the server use command `node index.js`
6. The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`
7. When you make a change you will need to restart the server to show that

## Dependancies
* MongoDB is used as the database
* Mongoose is used as the ODM
* Express is used as Node.js framework

## Todo
* Add linter
* Hot reload so that you don't have to manually restart the server
* Front end to consume the API
